<p>
I used to host my website on a BudgetVM 128MB VPS (OpenVZ) server with CloudFlare in front of it.  I've since moved it to GitHub Pages which now offers https (SSL) and a CDN all for free.

<p>
My page content has always been static anyway with some build scripts, but now I use the GitHub Pages tool Jekyll.
