<H3>Java Coding Example:  Design</H3>

<PRE>
<B>CheckBookMain</B> -- does min amount.  Starts the controller
and does nothing else.  This could be morifed into a app
that does checking accounts or loans or whatever
for now just starts the "check" area


<B>CheckBookController</B> -- does all of interfacing with the user
asks to create books & title them.
handles each book & each check in each one
it will  A.  create or delete checkbooks
            1. title each checkbook; (see Check class)
            2. offer a printout of each one
            3. (optional) save & read stored books
         B.  manage a particular book
            <S>1. add or delete checks</S>
            1. use CheckBook to add or delete (void) checks
            2. (optional) modify checks; recreate internally
            3. deposit or withdraw (see B-1)
            4. calculate new balances (see B-1)
            5. pick check nums on creation (pass to CheckBook)
         B-2.
            1. give a reister of all transactions using
               OutputBox for each Book & CheckBook register
         D.
            1. allow user to quit
            2. when user quits, dump a bank statement
               for all the books to a file
               Dump the outputBox objects

<U>Margin Notes:</U>
check num
write check
void
withdraw
deposit
register

Quit - dump Output Boxes
use savetoFile


<B>CheckBook</B> -- has methods to add checks, void checks,
    make withdraw and deposits.  It also calculates new
    balances based on transactions.  Also have an array
    with all transactions recorded (like a register).  Voided checks are
    marked, <S>it should be a structure?</S> (maybe new object?)
    Creates and destories registers;  Searches for checks?


<B>Check</B> -- holds info on chekcs, creates new ones
     check number - define on creation or defaulted by CheckBook
     <S>Owners Name on check</S> (moved to CheckBook)
     Date
     PayTo
     Written Amount
     Numerical Amount
     <S>Name of Bank</S> (moved to CheckBook)
     Memo, sig not important


<B>CheckBookRegister</B>
<S>
    holds info on a checkbook; it's index will match
    CheckBook's index array.
    Controlled by CheckBook.  CheckBook creates one when made,
      and removes it when destroyed

    NOTES:  Checks can get out of order, maybe resort them
      or allow user to sort by check num or date or amount?
</S>
