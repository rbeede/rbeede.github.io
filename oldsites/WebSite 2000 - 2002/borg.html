<H3>The Borg</H3>

I enjoy watching Startrek and I think that the Borg are really cool.  I have compilied a bunch of graphics, sounds, cursors, and even a screen saver into a Windows theme.  If you are using Windows 95 I recommend you download the <A HREF="http://home1.gte.net/fosterk/da/index.htm">Desktop Architect</A> to configure your Windows themes.  If you have Plus installed or are using Windows 98 you can just adjust your display properties to select the Borg theme.  Download the file below and extract it to your hard drive.  Then select "The Borg.Theme" as your Windows theme from the directory that you extracted the files to.  If you need more help <A HREF="./contact.html">contact me</A>.
