<H4>IPX Network</H4>

This type of multiplayer game uses a network to connect the different machines and allows for up to four players.  This requires that the IPX protocal be running on all of the computers that will participate in the game and this type of multiplayer game is usually the easiest to setup.  If you need more information on how to setup your Windows 95/98 network to support the IPX protocal CLICK HERE

<P>
The client(s) need(s) to click on these Diablo options:<BR>

<P>
Select your saved player from the list or create a new one

<P>
Select the name of the host's player from the list (not Create Game)

You should now enter the game.  If you get a message saying that your character doesn't have a high enough level then the host raised the difficulty to a setting higher then what your character can use.  You must either use a different character with a higher level or ask the host to change the difficulty to a lower setting.
