<H4>Modem-to-Modem</H4>

This type of game allows up to two players to play over their regular phone line.  Both players need to make sure that their operating system has a modem installed and that the person calling (making the phone call) can use touch-tones to dial out.  Both players must have the same (or very close) Diablo version or the game will never allow the other player to connect.  It is recommended that both players download and install the <A HREF="http://ftp.blizzard.com/Pub/diablo/drtl107.exe">Diablo 1.07 Patch</A>.

<P>
The first thing to decide on is who will host the game (listen for phone calls) and who will connect to the game (dial the phone number).

<P>
The host will click on these options in Diablo's main menu:<BR>
<I>Multiplayer</I>, <I>Modem</I>

<P>
Select your saved player from the list or create a new one

<P>
If you have more then one modem select your modem from the list that comes up.  The list only comes up if you have more then one modem installed

<P>
Click on <I>Create Game</I>

<P>
Select the difficulty (Normal is recommended)

<P>
The host will now be in the game and his/her computer's modem will be listening for incoming calls from another player.

<P>
The person calling (the client) should allow the host about two minutes to setup the game before calling the host computer.  You could also have the host call you up and tell you when they have got the game setup and listening for connections.

<P>
The client needs to click on these Diablo options:<BR>
<I>Multiplayer</I>, <I>Modem</I>

<P>
Select your saved player from the list or create a new one

<P>
If you have more then one modem select your modem from the list that comes up.  The list only comes up if you have more then one.

<P>
Click on <I>Enter New Number</I>

<P>
Type in the host's phone number and press enter.

<P>
The client's modem should now dial out to the host's modem.  When both modems connect the client should join in on the game and be able to play.  If the game complains about the modem make sure another program isn't using your modem.  If you get a busy signal then someone else called the host (and probably got that nice screeching sound from their modem) so try again in a couple of minutes.  If the game says it couldn't find a Diablo game (but you heard the modems connect) then make sure both of you are using the same Diablo version and that the phone number you are calling is the hosts.  I recommend using at a minimum a 28.8Kbps modem on both the host and client computers.
