<H3>Magic:  The Gathering</H3>

<P>
Magic is a card game in which you are a wizard against another wizard in control for a magical plane.  You must have a least two players but can have any number more to play.  Each player has a deck of at least 40 cards to play against the other players decks.

<P>
If you would like to learn how to play go to <A HREF="http://www.wizards.com/Magic/Fifth_Ed_Rulebook/Welcome.html" TARGET="new">5th Edition Rules</A> for more information on how to play the game and all the rules.
