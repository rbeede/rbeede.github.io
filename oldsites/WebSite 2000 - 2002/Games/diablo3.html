<H4>Direct Serial Link</H4>

I haven't actually tested this, but these directions should be good enough.  If they aren't try reading the directions on the Diablo CD or <A HREF="../contact.html">contact me</A> and I will try to help you out.

<P>
Diablo actually has special support for allowing up to four players to play in a direct serial link multiplayer game.  Most other games will only allow for up to two players to play in a direct serial link, but Blizzard has added extra routing technology to Diablo.  This type of play requires that a null-modem cable be used and that you have the latest version of Diablo installed.  A null-modem cable is a cable that basically has two wires crossed to allow the computers to share files between your serial (com) ports or printer ports.  You can pick one up at almost any Walmart or Radio Shack store.  Just make sure it says it is a null-modem or file transfer cable on it.  This way of playing can be better since you don't have to install a network to have four players, but most other games can't do this so I would only do it if you only need two computers playing and don't won't to spend money on installing a network.

<P>
To set this kind of game up hook up a null-modem cable to each computer.  If you are going to have two people play, you will need one cable; if you are going to have three people play, you will need two cables; if you are going to have four people play, you will need three cables.  If two people are playing, take the cable and plug each end into the back of one of the serial (com) ports on each machine.  If three people are playing take one cable and plug it into the first machine; then take the other end and plug it into the second machine.  Now take a second cable and plug one end into the other serial (com) port on the second machine; then take the other end (of the second cable) and plug it into a serial (com) port on the third machine.  If four people are going to play take one cable and plug it into the first machine; then take the other end of the first cable and plug it into a serial (com) port on the second machine.  Next, take the second cable and plug one end into the second machine; then take the other end of the second cable and plug it into the third machine.  Now, take the third cable and plug it into the free serial (com) port on the third machine; then take the other end of the third cable and plug it into a serial (com) port on the fourth machine.<BR>
I strongly recommend reading the documentation on the Diablo CD (serial.txt) to help understand this setup if you are going to use more than two players.  Checkout the picture below for a wiring example.<BR>

Once the cabling has been hooked up pick a machine to create the game and host it.
