<H3>What is Diablo</H3>

Diablo is a role-playing adventure game that has you take one of three characters into the dark levels of a dungeon to fight the hideous Diablo and his evil creations.  This is a definite buy to add to your collection and only costs $10 at your local Walmart.

Checkout <A HREF="http://www.blizzard.com/diablo/">http://www.blizzard.com/diablo/</A> for more info about this great game.

<H3>Diablo Cheats</H3>

In order to cheat at Diablo (even in multiplayer games) you must download and run a Diablo trainer.  What this program does is modify the game's memory while you are playing it to make you a god, have all the spells, load in any items, save and restore your characters to different computers, and other things.  The best one I've found is BobaFett's Trainer.  If all you want is to be able to backup your character then BoBaFeTT also has a mini version that will just save & load characters, import items, and modify your character's stats.  You can get all these great utilities from <A HREF="http://www.greatbobafett.com/">The Great BoBaFeTT's homepage</A>.

<H3>Diablo Patches</H3>

The latest and last supported patch made by Blizzard is 1.07.  You can get it at <A HREF="http://ftp.blizzard.com/Pub/diablo/drtl107.exe">http://ftp.blizzard.com/Pub/diablo/drtl107.exe (1.4MB)</A>.

<H3>Diablo Items</H3>

You use Diablo items for your trainer.  Items are the stuff your character can use (like books, weapons, potions, etc.) during the game.  You can even give your buddies <I>*valid*</I> game items by droping a saved version of that item (using a trainer of course) onto your belt (or inventory) and giving it to them.  Most item files you find on the Internet may not work with the BoBaFeTT trainer so here are the ones I have that I know work in Diablo (ver 1.07) with BoBaFeTT's Trainer (ver 5.6):

<LI><A HREF="diablo_rodneybrain.zip">Rodney's Brain</A></LI> -- Custom item I made
</UL>

The custom item I made using the Diablo Advanced Item Editor.  It allows you to mess around with any saved item files you have or create new custom items.  You cannot give other players custom items through the game.  They have to have the item file (.itm) and import it using a trainer.  I couldn't find a home web site for the Advanced Item Editor I use so you can download it from <A HREF="diablo_itemeditor.zip">here</A>.

<H3>Setting up Multiplayer Diablo Games</H3>

Diablo has very good multiplayer support.  You can play modem-to-modem, direct serial link, IPX network, or TCP/IP network games.  Blizzard has created a dedicated network for many of their games for playing over the internet for free.  Unfortunately due to many of the hacks and trainers for Diablo, anyone can cheat in a multiplayer Diablo game.  I myself enjoy playing multiplayer Diablo because I find it more fun then playing against just the computer, but due to all the cheaters I only play with my friends on my local LAN (that way I can make sure they aren't trying to cheat against me).  Diablo allows you to either team up with up to four other players and fight the computer or you can fight the human and computer characters all at once.  You can't use your characters you created in single player games, however, so you must create a new character for your multiplayer games.  Below I will describe how to setup each type of multiplayer game, but I would also recommend reading the instructions on the Diablo CD as they are very good.  If you have trouble <A HREF="../contact.html">contact me</A>.

<P>
For the sake of keeping this page small I have broken up each type of multiplayer game into sections.  Please select one from the list below:
