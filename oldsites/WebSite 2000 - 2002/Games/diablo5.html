<H4>Battle.net</H4>

Blizzard has a special service called Battle.Net that all their new games use for Internet play.  You have to use their service to play over the Internet via TCP/IP, but you can create private games on it if you want to.  I haven't messed with this a lot, but if you want some help using Diablo with this then <A HREF="../contact.html">contact me</A>.
