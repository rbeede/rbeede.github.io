Some of these codes will only work in single player games, but most others should work fine.

<H3>Modifications, Patches, and Utilities</H3>

You can download the shareware version of Quake (version 1.06) <A HREF="ftp://ftp.cdrom.com/pub/idgames/idstuff/quake/quake106.zip">here</A>.

<P>
Once you've done that go ahead and download the 1.08 executable update from <A HREF="ftp://ftp.cdrom.com/pub/idgames/idstuff/quake/quake108.zip">here</A>.  Just overwrite your existing QUAKE.EXE file.

<P>
If you have a video card that can do OpenGL I would get the OpenGL version of Quake as it looks great.  You can get it from <A HREF="http://www.fileplanet.com/index.asp?section=105&file=9836">PlanetQuake</A>.

<P>
Here are some neat utilites:

<H3>Console Commands</H3>

You can find a complete summary of these at <A HREF="http://www.planetquake.com/console/commands/quake.html">PlanetQuake.</A>

<H3>Setting up multi player games</H3>

Quake has four basic ways to play multi player games:  Modem, Direct Link, IPX Network, and TCP/IP.  The most common is probably TCP/IP play, followed by IPX Network.  It is recommended that all players have at least version 1.06 when playing.  Also of note is that if you are using WinQuake it will only do IPX and TCP/IP games.

<P>
<U>A word about servers</U>

<P>
There are two kinds of servers in Quake:  dedicated and non-dedicated.  A dedicated server means that the machine being used is not running the graphical part of Quake, but instead, it is running with just a text console on the screen.  This type of server provides fare gameplay for all the players involved.  When running a dedicated server, Quake doesn't have a person playing in the game on the computer running the server.

<P>
A non-dedicated server, on the other hand, is running a Quake server and allows a person to play in the game on the computer.  The only problem is the person playing will always be the first one in the level and have no lag (delay in game due to connection speed).  This will give that player a big advantage in the game.

<H4>Modem Play</H4>

I recommend that both players have at least a 28.8kbps modem or faster for this type of game.  Choose which player will host (listening for a telephone call) and which player will connect (dial the phone).  As far as I know this type of play only supports two people, but one may be able to use direct console commands to enable more connections.

<P>
<HR WIDTH=75%>
<FONT SIZE=-1><CENTER><B>The Host</B></CENTER></FONT>

The host is the person who will start the Quake server and have their modem listen for incoming calls.  If they are running a non-dedicated server they will have the most advantage as they will be given the top speed in the game.

<P>
The host will select these options from the main menu:

<P>
Multiplayer, New Game, Modem

<P>
For the PORT setting set it to the com port that your modem is on.

<P>
The IRQ setting should adjust to the same as your com port, if not then change it to the IRQ of your modem.

<P>
For BAUD, leave it at the default of 57600.  Now go into MODEM SETUP.

<P>
For most people TOUCH TONE DIALING should work fine; if not then change it to pulse.

<P>
In the box labeled CLEAR enter in <B>ATZ</B>.

<P>
In the box labeled INIT enter in <B>AT &F S0=1</B>.  If your modem needs more parameters (such as disabling call waiting) then consult your modem manual for the commands to add.

<P>
In the box labeled HANGUP enter in <B>AT H0 S0=0</B>.

<P>
Now select OK from the modem setup menu and then select OK from the new game - modem menu.

<P>
You should now be at the game options screen.  Set any options you like and hit Begin Game.  That will start you in the game and your modem will listen for incoming phone calls.

<P>
<HR WIDTH=75%>
<FONT SIZE=-1><CENTER><B>The Client</B></CENTER></FONT>

The client is the person who will make the phone call to the host.  They will generally have the slower gameplay.

<P>
The client selects these options from the main menu:

<P>
Multiplayer, Join A Game, Modem

<P>
For the PORT setting set it to the com port that your modem is on.

<P>
The IRQ setting should adjust to the same as your com port, if not then change it to the IRQ of your modem.

<P>
For BAUD, leave it at the default of 57600.  Now go into MODEM SETUP.

<P>
For most people TOUCH TONE DIALING should work fine; if not then change it to pulse.

<P>
In the box labeled CLEAR enter in <B>ATZ</B>.

<P>
In the box labeled INIT enter in <B>AT &F</B>.  If your modem needs more parameters (such as disabling call waiting) then consult your modem manual for the commands to add.

<P>
In the box labeled HANGUP enter in <B>AT H0</B>.

<P>
Next type in the phone number of the host and then select OK.

<P>
Your modem should dial out.  When you connect you will join in on the game.

<P>
<U>Troubleshooting</U>

<P>
If you are unable to connect to the host check the following things:

<UL>
<LI>Did your modem dial? -- Make sure the phone line is plugged in all the way</LI>
<LI>Did your modem not respond? -- Make sure another program isn't using the modem (like fax software or a connection to the Internet)</LI>
<LI>Did you hear the two modems connect? -- If so, the modems may not be compatiable or a bad phone line connection is being made.  Also make sure you have at least version 1.06 and have any patches or modifications that the host is running</LI>
<LI>Modem dials, other end picks up, but you don't here the host's modem -- Give the host some more time to get the game running.  Also make sure the host turned on autoanswer on their modem</LI>
</UL>

<H4>Direct Link Play</H4>

This format allows players to play using a null-modem (file transfer) cable.  You can get one of these cables at a Walmart or Radio Shack; just ask for a serial cable that will do file transfer.  If the cable says "Works with Win95/98 File Transfer" or something like that then it will work.  As far as I know only two players are supported in this type of connection but using some direct console commands could enable more.  To setup this type of game plug the null-modem cable into one of the serial (COM) ports on the back of each computer.

<H4>IPX Network</H4>

This type of play will probably be the fastest.  All the computers involved must be linked in a network for this to work.  This type of play allows for up to 16 players (which you must enable on the command line when you run Quake) and is usually the easiest to setup.

<P>
For the client, when you are at the game chooser screen if you see a duplicate of a game that just has a number behind it's name it is probably the same game but a difference in versions caused it to read funny.  Just select the one at the top of the list as it will work better.  If you are behind a LAN at your work it can be common for them to not allow you to play games like Quake over the network.  If the option to select IPX Network is not selectable you need to install the IPX Network protocal on your machine.

<H4>TCP/IP</H4>

This type of game requires that you know the IP address of a game you are wanting to connect to or that your buddies know your IP address.  There are a lot of front-ends that you can use to find games as well.  If you are using WinQuake this options will work automatically but if you are using the DOS version of Quake you need to run Q95.BAT from your Quake directory in order to enable TCP/IP.

<P>
I do not recommend connecting to a server or playing with someone else unless their ping (response time) is less then 400ms.  Anything greater just makes for sorry gaming.  Also remember, if you are not connecting to a dedicated server then the player who is serving will have a advantage.  If you often see a little graphic pop up on your screen that has a phone line disconnected from a phone jack that means that the connection has gotten really bad and is waiting for the server to respond.  I would try a different server or try exiting Quake and then reentering the game.
