Instructions:  This service provides an e-mail forwarding alias.  You must have an existing e-mail address in order to use this service.  You pick your desired @texasbites.com alias and it will forward any messages sent to it to your forwarding e-mail address.  Also of note is that some e-mail spam filters may initially filter out messages forwarded to you (such as hotmail.com's).  Most e-mail services provide a way to allow the e-mail through.  Hotmail for example will most likely initially filter messages into your Junk Mail folder.  To fix this just send yourself a test message at your @texasbites.com alias and then go into your Hotmail Junk Mail folder, select the forwarded e-mail, and click on the This is not junk mail button.
