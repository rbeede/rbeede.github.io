Tried this Alfa card in Ubuntu 20.04 (latest updates) but had the hardest time getting it to work in monitor mode. I run Ubuntu under a VMware Workstation VM with the USB passed to the VM. Attempting to use airmon-ng start wlx000000000000 would result in my kernel crashing. I found a resolution with the following method:

These commands worked for me:

<pre>
<code>
# All as root of course

apt-get purge -y rtl8812au-dkms


cd /root/

git clone https://github.com/aircrack-ng/rtl8812au.git

cd rtl8812au/

apt install dkms

./dkms-install.sh

# Important to do a reboot
/sbin/reboot

# replace wlx000000000000 with your cards interface name

airmon-ng
airmon-ng check kill
ip link set wlx000000000000 down
iw dev wlx000000000000 set type monitor
ip link set wlx000000000000 up
iw wlx000000000000 info
</code>
</pre>
