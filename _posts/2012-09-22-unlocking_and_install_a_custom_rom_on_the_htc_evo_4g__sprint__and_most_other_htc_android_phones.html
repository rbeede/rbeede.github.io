title: Unlocking and install a custom ROM on the HTC Evo 4G (Sprint) and most other HTC Android phones
---

Just some rough notes.  I wanted an official way versus using hacks and exploits to avoid viruses and what not.

<p>
I skip rooting your existing ROM since I assume you will be overwritting it with a custom ROM anyway.  Rooting would just involve installing the SU and Superuser.apk anyway.
</p>

<h2>Pre-requistes</h2>

<ol>
	<li>HTC Phone with SD Card and 300MB free space</li>
	<li>Okay with wiping all data and settings from the device!</li>
	<li><a href="http://developer.android.com/sdk/index.html">Android SDK</a>
		<ul><li>You just need the fastboot command and not the platform-tools or anything else really</li></ul>
	</li>
	<li><a href="http://www.htc.com/">HTC Sync</a> if you are using Windows since you'll need the drivers</li>
	<li>A Recovery Image
		<ul>
			<li><a href="http://www.clockworkmod.com/rommanager">ClockworkMod</a></li>
			<li>For HTC Evo 4G just pick the one for "HTC Evo"</li>
			<li>Look in the second column for the download link</li>
		</ul>
	</li>
	<li>A custom ROM
		<ul>
			<li><a href="http://www.cyanogenmod.com/devices">CyanogenMod</a></li>
			<li>You may also want GApps</li>
		</ul>

</ol>


<h2>Unlocking</h2>

<ol>
	<li>Download your custom rom zip and store it on your phone's sdcard in the root of the sdcard</li>
	<li>Download and include the gapps zip if you want it</li>
	<li>Power off your phone</li>
	<li>Remove the battery (or disable fastboot in the OEM firmware: home screen, menu, settings, Power, Fastboot or settings, Applications, Fastboot)</li>
	<li>Hold down the Volume Down button and Power button until the phone turns on</li>
	<li>Ensure your USB cable is connected</li>
	<li>Follow the instructions at <a href="http://www.htcdev.com/bootloader/">HTCDev</a>
		<ul><li>For the HTC Evo 4G use "All Other Supported Models"</li></ul>
	</li>
	<li>Once unlocked don't reboot, continue to next section</li>
</ol>


<h2>Booting custom recovery and flashing the custom rom</h2>

<ol>
	<li>fastboot boot customrecovery.img
		<ul><li>Where customrecovery.img is the name of the local image on your computer</li></ul>
	</li>
	<li>Use the custom recovery to flash the zip custom rom copy on your sdcard to your device</li>
	<li>Make sure to wipe all data and cache with the custom recovery you booted otherwise you will probably get an endless boot error</li>
	<li>You don't have to flash the custom recovery image if you don't want too.  I did so after I booted my custom ROM as that was easier.</li>
	<li>Reboot and enjoy</li>
</ol>


<h2>Troubleshooting</h2>

<ol>
	<li>If you get errors with fastboot not finding your device try running it with administrator privelege</li>
</ol>
