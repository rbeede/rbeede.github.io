title: Ubuntu vi or vim arrow key problem
---

After installing Ubuntu 9.10 64-bit I had problems with my arrow keys in VI.  I thought at first the problem was my remote ssh session over putty, but then a terminal on my local console did the same thing.

<p>
When in text insert/append mode pressing the arrow keys would insert A B C D into the document instead of moving the cursor.

In short vi-tiny was installed instead of the complete vim.  Just install vim and it will be fixed.
