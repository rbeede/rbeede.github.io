title: SSH Broken Pipe with VMware NAT
---

Ran into this problem when using the git clone command on a virtual machine inside VMware Workstation.  The latest version of OpenSSH utilizes QoS for IP packets, but the NAT software in VMware has a bug where this causes connections to fail.  This was especially a problem when I tried to run git clone because the error I received was packet_write_wait: Connection to 192.0.2.100 port 22: Broken pipe

<p>
The cause and workaround is documented in multiple places
