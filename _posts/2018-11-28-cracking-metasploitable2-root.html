title: Cracking Metasploitable2 Root Password Hash
---

Playing with this test VM pulled the root entry in /etc/shadow.

<p>
<pre>root:$1$/avpfBJ1$x0z8w5UF9Iv./DR9E9Lid.:0:0:root:/root:/bin/bash</pre>
</p>

<p>
Not really required to get root, but I wanted to see if I could find the password.  I splun up a cloud server with compute optimization (vCPU dedicated) and ran John the Ripper.
</p>

<pre>
john --fork=2 unshadowedMetasploitable2
</pre>

<p>
2 cores on a Intel(R) Xeon(R) CPU E5-2680 v2 @ 2.80GHz.
</p>

<h3>Results</h3>

<p>
Running continous for 2,471 hours (102 days) has not resulted in the password.
</p>

<p>
The last status line from today:

<pre>
1 0g 103:02:08:06 3/3 0g/s 6268p/s 12537c/s 12537C/s aj1ahcal..aj1ahcan
2 0g 103:02:08:06 3/3 0g/s 6268p/s 12537c/s 12537C/s mbunrl#6..mbunrl#@
</pre>
</p>

<p>
I don't have any GPU instances because I wanted to test with a low-cost cloud server to see how far it could get with low cost.
