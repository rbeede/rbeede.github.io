title: Boot USB drive on older BIOS
---

Some older BIOS have early USB boot support, but it doesn't alway seem to work.

<p>
I have a EliteGroup K7S5A Pro motherboard that detects a 1GB USB flash drive as "USB-RFD" that will not boot from a normally formatted and partitioned USB drive.  I found the following solutions to handle older BIOS with legacy USB boot methods.
</p>

<p>
BIOS settings to use:
</p>

<ol>
<li>USB Function Support = Enabled</li>
<li>USB Function for DOS = Disabled</li>
<li>Thumb = Disabled</li>
<li>Hit F8 to bring up the boot menu or configure it in your bios if you like</li>
</ol>

<p>
Making the USB drive bootable:
</p>

<ol>
<li>Plug the USB drive into a Linux machine</li>
<li>Wipe the drive with <b>dd if=/dev/zero of=/dev/sd<i>X</i> bs=64k</b></li>
<li><b>mkdiskimage -4 /dev/sd<i>X</i> 0 64 32</b>
    <ul>
          <li>This creates a single partition as the "4th" partition which allows the older BIOS to boot the usb drive like a ZIP drive which it expects since it uses an older boot method</li>
          <li>You can also use another partition program and mkfs just make sure to create it as the 4th partition with 64 heads, 32 sectors</li>
     </ul>
</li>
<li><b>mkfs.msdos /dev/sd<i>X</i>4</b> (Important that it is made FAT16)</li>
<li><b>syslinux /dev/sd<i>X</i>4</b> to make it bootable</li>
</ol>
