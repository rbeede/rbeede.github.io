title: Create local Perl library of modules not installed by administrator or root
---

<a href="http://search.cpan.org/~ether/local-lib-1.008010/lib/local/lib.pm">Local::Lib</a> is the Perl module you want.  Combine that with <a href="./Dynamically_load_Perl_library_modules_based_on_script_location.html">Dynamically load Perl library modules based on script location</a> to get local-lib into your Perl script, and you should find it easier to download a missing module along with all of its dependencies.

<p>
Note that for modules that have compiled code you are still looking at platform specific builds.
