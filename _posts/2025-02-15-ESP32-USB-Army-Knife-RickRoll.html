title: ESP32 USB Army Knife - RickRoll
---

See <a href="ESP32-USB-Army-Knife.html"></a> for the tutorial on setup.

<h3>Setup</h3>

This one is easy and only requires copying the files to the microSD card. Grab the exmaple files from <a href="https://github.com/i-am-shodan/USBArmyKnife/tree/master/examples/rickroll">https://github.com/i-am-shodan/USBArmyKnife/tree/master/examples/rickroll</a>. I even submitted a pull request that was merged which makes it more reliable on Windows systems.

<h3>Execution</h3>

<ol>
  <li>Plug in the device</li>
  <li>Enjoy the browser video</li>
  <li>Observe the fun sequence of images on the USB device LCD</li>
  <li>Look at WiFi networks around you to see the lyrics as network SSIDs</li>
</ol>

Pretty easy one to do and show the basic HID functionality along with extra ESP32 capabilities work. Easy to customize as well.
