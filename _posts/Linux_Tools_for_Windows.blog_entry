title: Linux Tools for Windows
---

Below you can download some Linux tools that have been compiled for Windows care of the GnuWin32 project. These are some common tools I use on Linux all the time and find very useful for use on Windows as well.<br /><br />
I grabbed most of the builds from the <a href="http://gnuwin32.sourceforge.net/">GnuWin32</a> project. I prefer to use just this minimum set of tools instead of installing lots of packages from the GnuWin32.  I also don't use the Cygwin set because you have to manage conflicts with the cygwin.dll.<br />
<br />
The current assembly date for these packages is July 31, 2017.<br />
