title: Running MySQL from your Home Directory
---

I was needing to setup a test MySQL installation on a Linux server but didn't have root access.  I decided to just run the copy under my user name in my home folder instead.
<p>
Do all of the following with the current directory as the folder where you decompressed MySQL.
</p>

<p>
MySQL 5 was used.
</p>

<h3>Creating the database the first time</h3>

<pre>./scripts/mysql_install_db --basedir=$PWD --datadir=./data/</pre>

<h3>Starting</h3>

<pre>./bin/mysqld -b $PWD --datadir=./data --socket=/tmp/mysql.sock &</pre>

<h3>Stopping</h3>

<pre>mysqladmin shutdown --socket=/tmp/mysql.sock -u root</pre>

<h3>Starting listening over TCP/IP only via localhost connections</h3>

<pre>./bin/mysqld -b $PWD --datadir=./data --socket=/tmp/mysql.sock –bind-address=127.0.0.1 &</pre>
