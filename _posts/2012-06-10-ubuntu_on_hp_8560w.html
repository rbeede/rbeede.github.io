title: Ubuntu on HP 8560w
---

So I have a new workstation notebook from my new job.  It's an HP EliteBook 8560w with the nVidia graphics card option.

<p>
Short story it wasn't working with Ubuntu.  The default included graphics drivers for Ubuntu 12.04 and before have a bug which causes the screen to be unreadable.

The work around was provided by this most helpful website:  <a href="http://beradrian.wordpress.com/2012/06/10/install-ubuntu-12-on-8560w/">http://beradrian.wordpress.com/2012/06/10/install-ubuntu-12-on-8560w/</a>
