title: reCAPTCHA weakened
---

So for my Computer Vision graduate class at the University of Colorado I choose to do an analysis of reCAPTCHA and algorithms used to defeat it.

<p>
With a success rate of up to 23% automated software using vision algorithms can successfully get around the CAPTCHA.  This still allows a large amount of SPAM to get through.  There are other CAPTCHA systems that fair a little better, but it is only a matter of time before those are broken too.  We'll have to wait and see what comes along next to thwart spammers.
