title: LG Fusic (LX550) and vibrate problem
---

So I got a LG Fusic.  For some reason it kept vibrating every 2-5 minutes even though I had no new alerts/messages nor had any missed/incoming calls.
<p>
I found that I had to turn-off message reminders to get it to stop.  A known bug in the phone for years now.  I find LG cell phones to be low quality in general now.

<ol>
<li>Menu (press MENU)</li>
<li>Settings (press #)</li>
<li>Messaging (press 6)</li>
<li>Message Reminder (press 2)</li>
<li>Set to off</li>
</ol>

You can still get notification when a voicemail/text message/etc. arrives, but you won't get reminders of unread ones.  Better than the thing vibrating all the time and killing the battery.
