title: Router Forced TOR Access Point
---

<p>
I wanted to have an OpenWRT configuration that would force a wireless router to push all traffic (including UDP DNS) over TOR. This reduces the chance of identity leaks and makes for a simpler configuration to connect to TOR. The network performance was around 9mbps when using a fiber connection (500/200) so it was usable for basic Internet usage.

<h3>Equipment Used</h3>

<ul>
<li>Netgear R7800</li>

</ul>
