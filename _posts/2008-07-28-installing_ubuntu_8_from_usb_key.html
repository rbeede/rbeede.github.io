title: Installing Ubuntu 8 from usb key
---

I needed to install Ubuntu on a laptop without a CDROM drive.  I followed the guide on <a href="https://help.ubuntu.com/community/Installation/FromUSBStick">https://help.ubuntu.com/community/Installation/FromUSBStick</a> for directions to install via a USB drive.
<p>
I copied all the files to the usb key and made it bootable as per instructions on the web, but the installer doesn't seem to work.  I can boot from the USB key and get a live session working, but installing to hard disk just doesn't seem to work.
</p>

<p>
I keep getting the following error:
[Errno 5] Input/output error 
</p>

<p>
My guess is that it cannot find some file on the usb key or something.  If I figure it out I'll post an update here.
</p>

<p>
My setup:
</p>

<ul>
<li>Ubuntu 8.04</li>
<li>Dell D430 laptop</li>
<li>1GB generic USB key drive</li>
</ul>

<p>
<b>Update</b>
</p>

<p>
I looked into the system's log and noticed a bunch of these errors:
[  254.136906] SQUASHFS error: sb_bread failed reading block 0x73aef<br />
[  254.136910] SQUASHFS error: Unable to read page, block 1ceb2f80, size 8e6c<br />
[  254.136958] SQUASHFS error: zlib_inflate returned unexpected result 0xfffffffd, srclength 131072, avail_in 126, avail_out 131072
</p>

<p>
Most people report that is due to a faulty iso or cd, but I am using a usb key drive and have downloaded the iso multiple times with no change.  Others have suggested possible faulty memory on the machine, so I'm going to test that next.
</p>

<p>
<b>Resolved!</b>
</p>

<p>
Turns out I have a usb key drive that is damaged.  Even though I ran chkdsk and also used HDTune disk scan it still didn't work.  I ran Linux's badblocks to find the defective sectors.
</p>

<p>
Either way I used a different usb key drive, and it worked just fine.
