title: Blackberry, Can't add member to group
---

I was trying to create a group in my Blackberry to group my contacts into different areas.  When I got to the "Select Address" screen it would not allow me to select anything.  Instead clicking the scroll wheel just brought up the contact for editing.

The problem is a "group" is really meant for e-mail groups.  If the contact doesn't have an e-mail address then you can't add it to a group.  I'm going to try categories instead.
