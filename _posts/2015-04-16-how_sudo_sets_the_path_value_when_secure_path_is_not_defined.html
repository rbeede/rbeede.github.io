title: How sudo sets the PATH value when secure_path is not defined
---

Ran across an interesting technical detail while working on a PATH configuration problem in my /etc/profile.  When no PATH is defined (such as when you do sudo -i) the sudo command will inject a standard one that is compiled into its code.  This applies when you do not have a secure_path option either in your config or built-in as a compile option at build time.

<p>
This was important because when using bash and before your /etc/profile configures your PATH variable there will be an already existing value setup by the sudo -i command (or sudo -s env).  This mostly affected me due to some invocations creating a PATH with two colons (::) in it which was a security issue for root since that implies the current working directory is in root's PATH.
</p>

<p>
Testing was done on a Red Hat 6.  Sudo version 1.8.6p3 with 1.8.6p3-12.el6.

Before /etc/profile the sshd process sets PATH=/usr/local/bin:/bin:/usr/bin  (or whatever value your OpenSSH was configured and compiled to use).

sudo -i  OR  sudo -s env

Before /etc/profile the sudo process sets PATH=/usr/bin:/bin:/usr/sbin:/sbin
