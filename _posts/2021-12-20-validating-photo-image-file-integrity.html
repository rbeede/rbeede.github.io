title: Validating Photo Image File Integrity
---

I discovered over time that some of my photo files have corruption in them. I wrote a small bash script that could be run to detect corrupt files so I could try to find older backup archives of them.

<pre>
#!/bin/bash

# ImageMagik needs to be instlaled

export IFS=$&apos;\n&apos;

export LOGFILE=/tmp/$0.LOG

date --utc &gt; &quot;$LOGFILE&quot;

# 0 is good, 1 is bad
echo &quot;Filepath	ExitCode&quot;


for filepath in $(find $1 -type f -iname &apos;*.jpeg&apos; -o -iname &apos;*.jpg&apos; -o -iname &apos;*.png&apos; -o -iname &apos;*.gif&apos;); do
	echo -n $filepath
	echo -n &quot;	&quot;
	
	cmdoutput=$(identify -verbose &quot;$filepath&quot; 2&gt;&amp;1)

	echo -n $?
	echo &quot;&quot;

	echo $cmdoutput &gt;&gt; &quot;$LOGFILE&quot;
done
</pre>
