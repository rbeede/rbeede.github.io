title: Google Fi to Boost Mobile and Device does not appear to be eligible for activation.
---

Found a good sale on Boost Mobile. Figured since they both used T-Mobile towers might as well save some money. Ordered a SIM card on sale with a $10 credit for $16 after shipping.

Device does not appear to be eligible for activation
</p>

<p>
Everytime I entered my IMEI that error came up. I even called 611 from my phone (with the Boost SIM in it). The customer support rep encountered the same issue.
</p>

<p>
Turns out that because Google Fi and Boost Mobile use the same towers the phone appears in-use. I started the process in Google Fi to port my phone number out, but even after letting that sit overnight I still get the same error.
</p>

<p>
So it appears to port out I need to remove my active (Google Fi still works even while in port-out mode) phone from Google Fi first and wait a few hours. Boost Mobile won't activate a device that is still in-use in my case.
