title: Google Fi to Boost Mobile and Device does not appear to be eligible for activation.
---

Found a good sale on Boost Mobile. Figured since they both used T-Mobile towers might as well save some money. Ordered a SIM card on sale with a $10 credit for $16 after shipping.

<p>
Device does not appear to be eligible for activation
</p>

<p>
Everytime I entered my IMEI that error came up. I even called 611 from my phone (with the Boost SIM in it). The customer support rep encountered the same issue.
</p>

<p>
Turns out that because Google Fi and Boost Mobile use the same towers the phone appears in-use. I started the process in Google Fi to port my phone number out, but even after letting that sit overnight I still get the same error.
</p>

<p>
So it appears to port out I need to remove my active (Google Fi still works even while in port-out mode) phone from Google Fi first and wait a few hours. Boost Mobile won't activate a device that is still in-use in my case.
</p>

<h3>Update</h3>

<p>
I contacted Google Fi support. They instructed me to wipe both the cache and storage for the Google Fi app on my phone. This then allowed me to get to "Your device is eligible to be activated on the Boost Mobile Network. For English, please call 844-817-8093 to activate. For Spanish, please call 855-209-8691 to activate."
</p>

<p>
My next step was to switch my phone over to the Boost network.
</p>

<p>
My switchover attempt failed. I called the number to activate, and the agent could not get the phone activated.
