title: XHTML 1.0, Internet Explorer, application/xhtml+xml
---

So Internet Explorer 6, 7, and 8 do not support XHTML whereas pretty much every other browser does.  This is unfortunate because XHTML provides a nice well formed document layout.
<p>
One can simply set the mime type to text/html to get IE to work around the problem, but you lose some advantages of the XML validation.
</p>

<p>
So I read the <a href="http://www.w3.org/MarkUp/2004/xhtml-faq#ie">FAQ from w3.org</a> on how to work around IE.  Since I am writing a Java application whenever it sees that the User-Agent browser header contains MSIE I have it modify the content type from "application/xhtml+xml" to "application/xml" instead.  This could be done via Apache HTTP server for static pages too.
</p>

<p>
Basically to get it to work I just followed the instructions from w3.org with the exception that I had to leave out the DOCTYPE in my documents to avoid errors in IE.
</p>

<p>
So standards compliant browsers (Firefox, Chrome, etc) get "application/xhtml+xml" whereas IE gets just "application/xml" for the content type.  This allows my XHTML pages to render correctly in all browsers.
