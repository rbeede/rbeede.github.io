I wanted to try-out using my Raspberry Pi 4B as an exit node but on a network that may have CGNAT (no port forwarding/DMZ possible). I followed the guide at <a href="https://docs.zerotier.com/exitnode/">https://docs.zerotier.com/exitnode/</a> using a Raspberry Pi 4B with Raspberry Pi OS Lite (64-bit).

<p>
The new OS version uses nftables instead of iptables. It was actually simpler to setup as I only had the one eth0 interface and did not want any firewall blocking rules (to allow easier remote setup of the device on-site). I used the Red Hat reference at <a href="https://docs.redhat.com/en/documentation/red_hat_enterprise_linux/7/html/security_guide/sec-configuring_nat_using_nftables#sec-Configuring_destination_NAT_using_nftables">documentation</a> as there were not very many simple nftables for routing via NAT examples.
</p>



<pre>
nft flush ruleset

nft add table nat

nft -- add chain nat prerouting { type nat hook prerouting priority dstnat \; }
nft add chain nat postrouting { type nat hook postrouting priority srcnat \; }

# WAN interface for exit node to reach the Internet
export WAN_IF=eth0
nft add rule nat postrouting oifname "$WAN_IF" masquerade

# Observe that NO deny rules are in-use. If you need them you should add them
</pre>

<p>
Don't forget to <a href="https://docs.zerotier.com/exitnode/#enable-ipv4-forwarding-on-the-exit-node">enable ipv4 forwarding</a>
</p>

<p>
Save the changes so they persist across reboots
</p>

<pre>
echo 'flush ruleset' > /etc/nftables.conf
echo '' >> /etc/nftables.conf

nft list ruleset >> /etc/nftables.conf
</pre>
