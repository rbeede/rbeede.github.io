title: HP Pavilion Laptop, HP Quick Launch, and Windows XP SP3
---

So I did a fresh install of Windows XP Pro SP3 (32-bit) on a HP Pavilion dv1000 CTO laptop.  I tried installing the QuickPlay drivers given on HP's website for that model.  The buttons did not work after installation.
<p>
I tried the following to (unsuccessfully) fix the issue:
</p>

<ol>
<li>Uninstall any QuickPlay (QuickLaunch) software via Control Panel</li>
<li>Install .NET Framework 2.0 runtime (redist) or later</li>
<li>Install the QuickLaunch software
     <ol>
     <li>I used version QuickLaunch - 6.40.8.2H,20Aug2008 -- sp40139</li>
     <li>Try doing a search on HP's <b>business</b> support website for "HP Quick Launch Buttons" <a href="http://h20000.www2.hp.com/bizsupport/TechSupport/Home.jsp">link</a></li>
     </ol>
</li>
<li>Reboot when asked</li>
</ol>

<p>
So Windows XP SP3 and Quick Launch (Quick Play) buttons do not work yet.  Hopefully HP will find a solution to this issue and release an updated version.
</p>

<p>
Note however that even without installing the driver the volume up/down, mute, play, pause, forward, back, and stop buttons still tend to work.  The DVD and â™« buttons will not work until HP resolves this issue.
