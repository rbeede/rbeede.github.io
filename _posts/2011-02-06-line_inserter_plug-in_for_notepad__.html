NotePad++ Line Inserter Plug-in

So I've written a plug-in that will insert " at the beginning and end of all lines in the current document.

<p>
You need to (manually) install the NppScripting plug-in by Kremer Eugen (http://www.softwarecanoe.de/data/nppscripting.zip) and copy the lineinserter.js file into the "includes" folder for that plug-in.
</p>

<p>
I wanted to make it prompt for the text to insert, but there isn't a good API in the NppScripting plug-in for doing so.  I tried the provided Dialog class, but the IE window wouldn't open with focus on Windows 7.  Any ideas on how to prompt the user for input?
