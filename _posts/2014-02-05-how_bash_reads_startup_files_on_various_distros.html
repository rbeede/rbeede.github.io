title: How bash reads startup files on various distros
---

Some notes on how bash reads startup files.  Some distros compile with the SYS_BASHRC flag which can add some startup files.

<p>
In most cases /etc/bashrc (or similar /etc) files are not read by bash itself by are sourced by other startup files instead.  See /etc/profile, ~/.bash* files, ~/.profile, and /etc/skel/.bash* (or .profile) files.
</p>

<pre>
login shell (interactive or non-interactive)
    /etc/profile
    First one that is readable
        ~/.bash_profile
        ~/.bash_login
        ~/.profile
    Can use --noprofile option to disable all of these above options
    Upon exit reads ~/.bash_logout (and some distros /etc/bash.bash_logout)
    

non-login shell + interactive
    /etc/bash.bashrc    (Ubuntu/Debian SYS_BASHRC special)
    ~/.bashrc
    Can use --norc to disable
    Can use --rcfile to force one specific file instead
    
"sh" invocation
    /etc/profile
    ~/.profile
</pre>

<p>
You also see on some distros /etc/bashrc (versus /etc/bash.bashrc).  This is typically (see SYS_BASHRC for exception) not read by bash itself but instead sourced by ~/.bashrc (which is typically sourced by ~/.profile or ~/.bash_profile).
</p>

<p>
Other invocation methods have environment variables that specify a startup file to read.  POSIX mode (--posix) turns off startup files except for env.
</p>

<p>Consult the bash man page or <a href="http://www.gnu.org/software/bash/manual/bashref.html#Bash-Startup-Files">Bash Reference Manual</a> for more info.

<p>
To tell if your distro uses the SYS_BASHRC compile option try "man bash" on your running distro and look in the INVOCATION section.
