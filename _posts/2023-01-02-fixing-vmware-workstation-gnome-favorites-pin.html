title: Fixing VMware Workstation Gnome Favorites Pin
---

If you run from a terminal command-line <b>vmware</b> it won't attach to your pinned Gnome favorite. This fix is:

<pre>
vim /usr/share/applications/vmware-workstation.desktop

# Add this line to the end


StartupWMClass=Vmware
</pre>

<p>
  This community post gave a hint as to how to fix this problem in general: <a href="https://askubuntu.com/questions/1378642/application-in-the-dock-cant-be-added-to-favourites">https://askubuntu.com/questions/1378642/application-in-the-dock-cant-be-added-to-favourites</a>
