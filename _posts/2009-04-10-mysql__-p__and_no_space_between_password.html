title: MySQL, -p, and no space between password
---

So for the mysql command line utilities (ex: mysqldump) you can specify the password on the command-line with -pPASSWORD or --password=PASSWORD.  You cannot have a space in between like "-p PASSWORD".
<p>
I was wondering why and found the <a href="http://bugs.mysql.com/bug.php?id=7614">following bug report</a> that explains it.  In short the password value is optional since -p alone means prompt the user for the password.  Most other utilities use something like "-p -" to indicate prompt from STDIN for the password.  MySQL does not.

One shouldn't pass the password on the command-line anyway.  You're better off putting it in a mysql.ini and securing the file instead if you need it for automation.
