title: McAfee Denial of Service bug I found
---

I discovered a DoS bug in McAfee's enterprise client "FrameworkService.exe" that I reported in September, 2013.  McAfee just released a public Security Bulletins about it at:

<p>
<a href="https://kc.mcafee.com/corporate/index?page=content&id=SB10055">McAfee Security Bulletin - McAfee Managed Agent update fixes the "Denial of Service" vulnerability against the FrameworkService.exe</a>
</p>

<p>The CERT Vulnerability Note <a href="http://www.kb.cert.org/vuls/id/613886">VU# 613886</a> has been published.</p>

<p>The CVE is <a href="http://web.nvd.nist.gov/view/vuln/detail?vulnId=CVE-2013-3627">CVE-2013-3627: McAfee Agent v4.6 Denial of Service</a></p>

<p>
I had some initial difficulty finding how to contact the vendor, but McAfee did reach back out to me later so I could report it.
