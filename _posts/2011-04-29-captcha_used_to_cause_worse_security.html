title: CAPTCHA used to cause worse security
---

I noticed on Facebook the other day an odd post by one of my friends:

<p>
<img src="./images/FacebookCaptchaScam2011-04-29.png" />
</p>

<p>
Turns out not a virus was responsible for posting it on my friend's wall but instead a fake CAPTCHA that fooled the user into posting it on their wall.
</p>

<p>
Users get so trained into thinking they have to fill these things out when in reality this "CAPTCHA" was just a form to force a post on their wall.  Most likely to get the video/website author more traffic and money from ad revenue by tricking someone into advertising it on their wall.

In another blog of mine I've already shown how CAPTCHA have been broken as a means of SPAM prevention anyway.  Now we find them as a new method of tricking users.
