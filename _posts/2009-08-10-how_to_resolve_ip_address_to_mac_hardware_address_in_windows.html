title: How to resolve IP address to MAC hardware address in Windows
---

I use this command from time to time on my Windows XP box and wanted to document it for reference.
<p>
ping <i>www.xxx.yyy.zzz</i> &nbsp; (to get the entry in the arp cache)<br />
arp -a <i>www.xxx.yyy.zzz</i>
</p>

<p>
Note that your ARP cache will probably only be for your subnet that the machine is on.
