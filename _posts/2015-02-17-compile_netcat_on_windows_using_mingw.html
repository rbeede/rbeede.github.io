title: Compile Netcat on Windows using MinGW
---

I wanted a way to compile Netcat on Windows using MinGW so I could have a version without the GAPING_SECURITY_HOLE option (-e command line option).  This helps to avoid the annoyance of anti-virus tools reporting it as a virus/trojan and also gives me a binary I know isn't infected with something.
<p>
Doing so on Windows is a real pain since there isn't a straight forward make file for MinGW.  It seemed mostly geared at Microsoft VC.
</p>

<p>
Just copy and paste the following text into a "makewin.cmd" file in the same directory as the source.  A good place to get source for Windows is <a href="http://joncraton.org/blog/46#comment-14590181">http://joncraton.org/blog/46#comment-14590181</a> (this also includes a binary for Netcat for Windows but the -e option is still turned on).
</p>

<p>
I also have a build of Netcat (nc.exe) that you can download <a href="/downloads/nc.exe">here</a>.<br />
A copy of the source code with makewin.bat is at <a href="/downloads/nc111nt_rodneybeede.zip">here</a>.  This only has the source and build files, no executable.<br />
In addition you can find other sites that provide mirrors at <a href="http://www.thaoh.net/Tools/Netcat/">http://www.thaoh.net/Tools/Netcat/</a>
</p>

<p>
You'll need MinGW with gcc (MinGW.org GCC-8.2.0-3) 8.2.0.  Modify the paths in the batch script as needed and run it.  You should get a nc.exe file if all went well.

@REM	Adjust PATH so necessary dll's are accessible
SET PATH=%PATH%;c:\MinGW\bin

SET COMPILER=c:\MinGW\bin\gcc.exe
SET LIB_DIR=c:\MinGW\lib

@REM	not needed? SET COMPILE_OPTIONS=-c -DWIN32 -DNDEBUG -D_CONSOLE -DTELNET
SET COMPILE_OPTIONS=-c

del *.o
del nc.exe

"%COMPILER%" %COMPILE_OPTIONS% getopt.c

"%COMPILER%" %COMPILE_OPTIONS% doexec.c

"%COMPILER%" %COMPILE_OPTIONS% netcat.c

@REM Note that the -l libraries MUST come at the very end or linking will fail
