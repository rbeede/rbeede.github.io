title: Compile Netcat on Windows using MinGW
---

I wanted a way to compile Netcat on Windows using MinGW so I could have a version without the GAPING_SECURITY_HOLE option (-e command line option).  This helps to avoid the annoyance of anti-virus tools reporting it as a virus/trojan and also gives me a binary I know isn't infected with something.
<p>
Doing so on Windows is a real pain since there isn't a straight forward make file for MinGW.  It seemed mostly geared at Microsoft VC.
</p>

<p>
Just copy and paste the following text into a "makewin.cmd" file in the same directory as the source.  A good place to get source for Windows is <a href="http://joncraton.org/blog/46#comment-14590181">http://joncraton.org/blog/46#comment-14590181</a> (this also includes a binary for Netcat for Windows but the -e option is still turned on).  I also have a build of Netcat that you can download <a href="./downloads/nc111nt_rodneybeede.zip">here</a>.  In addition you can find other sites that provide mirrors at <a href="http://www.thaoh.net/Tools/Netcat/">http://www.thaoh.net/Tools/Netcat/</a>
</p>

<p>
You'll need MinGW with gcc version 3.4.5 (I used MinGW 5.1.4.  Modify the paths in the batch script as needed and run it.  You should get a nc.exe file if all went well.
