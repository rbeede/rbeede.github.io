title: Raspberry Pi 4 as a NAS
---

I recently acquired a Raspberry Pi 4 B with 8GB of RAM. In a test benchmark setup I was able to saturate the gigabit wired link with a file transfer between a Windows 10 client and the Raspberry Pi.

<p>
I am using a 64GB microSD card (class U1). I also installed 5 heatsinks on the Pi and used a case with a small 5V fan. Connection is via a gigabit switch between the client and the Pi. I have the latest Raspberry Pi OS lite 64-bit. My testing used a ramdisk so the microSD card was not a bottleneck.

Commands used for the setup:
</p>

<pre>
mkdir /mnt/ramdisk/

chmod 1777 /mnt/ramdisk/

mount -t tmpfs -o size=1g tmpfs /mnt/ramdisk/

dd if=/dev/urandom of=random.data bs=10M count=100 status=progress

apt-get install -y samba samba-common-bin

apt-get install -y vim /etc/samba/smb.conf

smbpasswd -a pi

systemctl restart samba
</pre>
