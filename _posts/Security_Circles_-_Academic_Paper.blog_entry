title: Security Circles - Academic Paper
---

For my Fall 2011 Mobile Computing class at the University of Colorado I participated in a group project regarding an Android security application.

<p>
The basic concept was to modify the Android OS so applications could be placed into "security circles" that would anonymize the sensor data.  This would allow a level of trust for various applications so they would still function, but they wouldn't have access to real data that could identify you.

We submitted the paper to MobiSys 2012.  You can download it <a href="./downloads/security_circles.pdf">here</a>.  It was also published as a technical report at the University of Colorado at Boulder <a href="http://digitool.library.colostate.edu/R/-?func=dbin-jump-full&amp;object_id=168176&amp;silo_library=GEN01">here</a>.
