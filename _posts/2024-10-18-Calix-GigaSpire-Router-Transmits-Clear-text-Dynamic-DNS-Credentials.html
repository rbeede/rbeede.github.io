title: Calix GigaSpire Router Transmits Clear-text Dynamic DNS Credentials
---

<p>
The Calix GigaSpire (and possibly other models) transmit credentials over the WAN interface in clear-text for Dynamic DNS services. This is done despite an encrypted alternative being available from the Dynamic DNS services.
</p>

<ol>
	<li>Calix GigaSpire BLAST Model: u6.1 GS4220E router (latest available firmware version 23.3.0.3.57)</li>
	<li>Setup a MitM bridge between the WAN and ONT to simulate an attacker listening to traffic.</li>
	<li>Observe that the router makes a request to <code>GET /v3/update?hostname=MYDYNHOSTENTRY.dyndns.org&myip=REDACTED HTTP/1.1\r\n</code></li>
	<li>Observe that TLS 1.2/1.3+ was not used (use of http: instead of https:)</li>
	<li>Observe that the credentials for the dynamic DNS were sent in the clear by the Calix client
<pre>
    GET /v3/update?hostname=MYDYNHOSTENTRY.dyndns.org&myip=REDACTED HTTP/1.1\r\n
    Host: members.dyndns.org\r\n
    Authorization: Basic bXl1c2VybmFtZTpteWNyZWQ\r\n
    User-Agent: curl/7.86.0\r\n
    Accept: */*\r\n
</pre>
	</li>
</ol>

<h3>Remediation Recommendation</h3>

The vendor does not provide any way to force the use of HTTPS/TLS. The service dyndns.org offers a working, encrypted (TLS) service at https://update.dyndns.org. A workaround is to not use the Calix router for dynamic DNS updates but instead another client on the LAN.

<h2>Update 2025-10-11</h2>

I never received a response from Calix, but the firmware update version 24.4.0.0.60 for the GS4220E did change the behavior. It now queries DNS for the Dynamic DNS entry and makes a call to members.dyndns.org using TLSv1.3. So the issue appears to have been resolved in a later firmware update.
