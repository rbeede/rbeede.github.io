title: Can't remote install Mac OS X Server - Snow Leopard 10.6 using Windows machine as DVD
---

I have a Mac Mini that came with Snow Leopard 10.6.  This Mac Mini doesn't include a DVD/CD drive.  I wanted to configure it with RAID which requires booting from the install DVD.

According to the documentation for Mac OS X Snow Leopard you can using a Windows host's (or another Mac) DVD drive to remote install the OS again.

Turns out the documentation is not for Mac OS X <b>Server</b> but only the non-server edition.  You can't use a Windows host to remote install the <b>Server</b> edition of Snow Leopard as the DVD contains no Windows files on it (I looked at it with ISOBuster to make sure).

I called Apple Enterprise support about this.  Your best bet is to get a USB/Firewire DVD drive or use another Mac instead.  Another option might be to boot from an 8GB+ USB thumb drive, but I haven't tried it.
