title: USB Key Drives, To Partition Or Not?
---

I was recently working with making some USB key drives bootable with Linux.  I noticed that some of my drives had single primary partitions on them while others had no partitions at all.
<p>
All of them use the FAT filesystem.  In my attempt to install grub on one it failed because it had no partitions.
</p>

<p>
Linux has no problem mounting drives with no partitions (referred to as raw devices).  Windows XP doesn't have issues either, but for "Removable" drives it does have the following behavior:
</p>

<ul>
<li>
If no partitions exist read the beginning sectors for a formatted filesystem.
<ul>
<li>If found then mount the raw filesystem and assign a drive letter</li>
<li>If not found then show a drive letter, but prompt for a disk to be inserted</li>
<li>If no partitions exist Disk Management also allows for one to create a single partition and format it</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>If any number of partitions exist read the first known partition type (FAT, FAT32, NTFS) and ignore any others</li>
<li>If no partitions exist but a valid filesystem was found don't allow any partition on the drive since it is "removable"</li>
</ul>

I've noticed the following about making a usb drive bootable for Linux:
</p>

<ul>
<li>
If using SYSLINUX then I don't have to have any partitions
<ul>
<li>However some buggy BIOSes (Award) do need at least one partition</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>If using GRUB you'd better have at least one partition</li>
<li>If booting with NTLDR (Windows boot loader) you need at least 1 partition which may need to be a special fourth partition (see BartPE)</li>
</ul>
