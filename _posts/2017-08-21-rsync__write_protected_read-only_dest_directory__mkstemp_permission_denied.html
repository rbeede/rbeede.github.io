title: rsync, write protected read-only dest directory, mkstemp Permission denied
---

Doing an rsync from Ubuntu 14 to a remote rsyncd daemon (not ssh but rsync protocol).

<p>
Keep getting mkstemp Permission denied (13) errors.
</p>

<p>
I had an rsync.d with <code>incoming chmod = F400,D500</code> so backed up files would be read-only.
</p>

<p>
For some transfers (smaller size) rsync is temporarily changing the dest folder permissions to allow write and make the transfer, but for other transfers (usually larger files multi-gigabytes) it would keep failing.
</p>

<p>
Looks like known design limitation causes this to occur. 
 <a href="https://bugzilla.samba.org/show_bug.cgi?id=6788">Skip file transfer if destination file cannot be opened for writing (6788)</a>
</p>

<p>
My solution was to allow owner write on all files and directories to avoid the wasted transfers.  <code>incoming chmod = F600,D700</code> and do a chmod -R u+w over the entire rsync share to allow user write.
