title: Mitigating attacks against FDE (BitLocker, TrueCrypt, etc) via Firewire, Thunderbolt, or DMA
---

Good Microsoft KB on how to prevent Firewire/Thunderbolt/DMA attacks against a live running system with software FDE.

<p>
<a href="http://support.microsoft.com/kb/2516445">Blocking the SBP-2 driver and Thunderbolt controllers to reduce 1394 DMA and Thunderbolt DMA threats to BitLocker</a>
</p>

<p>
Good for versions of Windows including and after Vista and Server 2008.
</p>

<p>
Windows 8.1 (not 8.0) actually mitigates the attack out of the box now!  See <a href="https://technet.microsoft.com/en-us/library/dn632181.aspx">Choose the Right BitLocker Countermeasure</a> on technet.microsoft.com (March 26, 2014).
</p>

<p>
Microsoft's site isn't the most clear since it tries to apply to many versions of Windows.  The instructions actually have text that doesn't 100% match what your version of Windows may have.

Windows 7 Quick Start:
</p>

<ol>
<li>Run the program  gpedit.msc</li>
<li>Local Computer Policy</li>
<li>Computer Configuration</li>

<li>Close the Show Contents window with OK</li>
<li>Scroll the Options: text area down until you see the checkbox option</li>
<li>Also apply to matching devices that are already installed.</li>
