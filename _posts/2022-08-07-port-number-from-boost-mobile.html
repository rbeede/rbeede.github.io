Want to port your phone number out without calling Boost Mobile support on the phone to get your account number and port pin?

<ol>
  <li>Log into your boost mobile account online</li>
  <li>Navigate to https://aka-apiservices.boostmobile.com/api/prepaid/1.0/accounts/4055340105/familyplandetails?idField=mdn</li>
  <li>View the page source. In the JSON ignore "mdn"</li>
  <li>Use subscriberId for the port account number</li>
  <li>For the port PIN just use your Boost Mobile account number</li>
</ol>

<p>
I used Burp proxy to view the content and find it. Ignore other ones that say CUSTOMER_ACCOUNT_ID as that is just your phone number which is not correct. Saves you from having to hear a sales pitch and wait in the phone queue.
