title: Cheap FIDO2 USB
---

I was looking for any way to have a FIDO2 USB security key that cost under $10. I found this project <a href="https://www.picokeys.com/pico-fido/">https://www.picokeys.com/pico-fido/</a> which seemed neat.

<p>
  I tested it with a LilyGo T-Dongle S3 USB device (ESP32-S3) and flashed the firmware. It worked! I could set a PIN on the device and enroll the FIDO2 key. Pressing the button on the device worked to authorize the key to test WebAuthN sites.
</p>

<h4>Cons:</h4>
<ol>
  <li>One device with shipping costs $25. There is a <a href="https://lilygo.cc/collections/lcd-oled">direct from OEM version without a display</a> for $11 (plus shipping/tax).</li>
  <li>It does not have a secure enclave for the secrets</li>
  <li>No NFC support</li>
  <li>Bluetooth existed but was not an option (no battery power)</li>
</ol>

<h3>Another Option</h3>

The project also supports the Raspberry Pico 2. I did not have one, but it appears to have Secure Boot and Secure Lock options.

<h4>Cons:</h4>
<ul>
  <li>The secure enclave is not well vetted yet</li>
  <li>Requires printing a case</li>
  <li>OEM version comes with a micro-USB port so a cable would be required</li>
  <li>No NFC support</li>
  <li>Larger form factor</li>
</ul>

<h4>Cost:</h4>
<i>Not including shipping + tax</i><br />
$5 for Pico 2<br />
$2 for a 3D printed case<br />
$4 for a cable from micro-USB to lightning or USB-C or USB-A<br />
<br />
Adding in shipping pushes over the $10 goal. Also the lack of NFC means more work to connect to tablets or phones.<br />

<h3>Summary</h3>

For around $19 you can get a USB security key with NFC and a smaller footprint. The Pico Fido project is cool and might make a good HSM for local dev work, but for FIDO2 security keys using a commercial product (or your smartphone) is still cheaper. It'd be nice to see a USB+NFC key that only cost $5 since it can offer better security than smartphones. A $5 price point would make it economical to replace if lost (just like house keys).

<p>Still going to keep looking for high security USB keys that cost little.</p>
