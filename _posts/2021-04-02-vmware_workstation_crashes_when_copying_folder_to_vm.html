title: VMware Workstation crashes when copying folder to VM
---

<p>
I005: FileIOCreateRetry: CreateFileW() returned ERROR_SHARING_VIOLATION, failing with FILEIO_CANCELLED
</p>

<p>
VMware Workstation Pro 15.5.7 build-17171714
</p>

<p>
Ubuntu 20.04 desktop guest VM with open-vm-tools<br />
Was started from a snapshot (may not matter?).
</p>

<p>
Steps to reproduce
</p>

<ol>
	<li>On Windows host create a folder</li>
	<li>Create and save an Excel xlsx inside that folder</li>
	<li>Keep the Excel file open</li>
	<li>Right click to copy the folder from the host</li>
	<li>Attempt to paste the folder into a sub-folder on the guest VM</li>
	<li>My mouse went erratic and within 30 seconds the vmx just crashed</li>
</ol>

<h3>Solution</h3>

<p>
Version 15.5 is out of contact support so I couldn't contact VMware. Probably need to not copy+paste anymore or buy the upgrade.
</p>

<h4>Did not help</h4>

<ul>
	<li>Uninstalled open-vm-tools, re-installed, rebooted, paste still crashed</li>
	<li>Uninstalled open-vm-tools, installed vmware-tools, Segmentation fault during install, finished install, rebooted, paste still crashed</li>
<ul>
